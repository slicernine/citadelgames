	<button class="accordion">Covert Reconnaissance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>With the help of Tenth-Code, Commander Borrington, Commander Bader, and Sharayda, you discovered The Controller, the long-dead being who built The Spine. It appears he was responsible for the mechanical anomalies plaguing the Flotilla. Since your meeting, these blips have ceased.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">The Real Test</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Having barely passed the written examination for your previous position as chief mechanic of The Conquest, you discovered that the Sith Lords and the Proctor had secretly been surveilling you for command aptitude. After passing that test, you were given an option of four different positions, and selected the one best suited to fast-paced battle assignments: commanding officer of The Warhawk and the rest of its attack craft squadron.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Vanguard Ascendent</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Darth Ares called you aboard The Titan, and the two of you had it out. Attempting to goad you into self-revelation, Ares insulted and dismissed your contributions to the Flotilla, and you left his presence dejected, but determined to earn whatever place you had not thus far.

	<br>Unbeknownst to you, Ares went on to sponsor you for a command position in the Flotilla, resulting in your promotion. You now understand his test of your character: you had to face your own jealousy, and reject it. He made you truly doubt all you'd accomplished in the Flotilla, and forced you to show your drive to prove yourself, taking charge and maintaining your zealous loyalty to the Flotilla in face of this insult. 

	<br>Passing his test with great gusto, you have earned Lord Ares' respect, and he named you Vanguard Caesar. You now stand as one of the Flotilla's elite defenders. 
</p></div>
	</div>
	  <div class="column archivemiddle">
	<button class="accordion">Rising Star of the Flotilla</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Having passed the officer's exam and the subsequent command entrance exam, you are now a commander in the Imperial Navy. As your career continues, you still have opportunity to earn promotions and special assignments, but your legacy amongst the celebrated Top Brass seems assured. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">On Thin Ice</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Upon constructing a new body, the former Controller has passed his title on to Tenth-Code. However, he wrote a failsafe into the Spine's core code that prevents its assets from working toward recognizable bias. Therefore, Tenth-Code must operate the Spine impartially, effectively immortalizing the distrust of your goals of conquest, and insuring the alliance between the Spine and the Sith will remain fairly distant. </p>
