	  <p><div class="post"><h2>Remembering a Friend</h2><h3>Though he has been dead for several weeks, there has been no time until now to mourn Atem's passing. Today, a memorial has been planned aboard The Flotilla. With his grandfather long overdue and his father sure not to return, his grandmother and mother have elected to hold the memorial the day his best friends wake from their Bacta induced sleep. 
	  <ul><li><b>Attend the Memorial.</b></li>
		  <p><li><i>[Optional]</i><b>: Prepare some words to say about Atem.</b></li></p></ul></h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>The Flotilla Council</h2><h3>Upon his return, Lord Malgus recognized all of you as the leaders and valued members of the Flotilla that you have become. Aside from receiving a special commendation and award from him personally, you have also been appointed to a special selection committee who will choose the Flotilla's official Leadership Council. Before the war begins, you must nominate those whom you believe to be the best leaders in the Flotilla, filling a seven-seated council from the ground-up. Once the candidates are nominated, the selection committee will appoint the council of 7 from amongst this pool of nominees.</h3></p>  
	<ul><li><b>Nominate capable candidates for the Flotilla Leadership Council.</b></li>
		<p><i><ul><li>You may nominate up to 3 people.</li></ul></i></p>
		  <p><li>Meet with the rest of the selection committee to choose a council of 7 Leaders from amongst the pool of nominees.</li></p></ul>
	<p><h3><b>Note:</b> Darth Malgus, Darth Viscerious, and Darth Ares cannot be nominated to serve on the Leadership Council, which will preside over day-to-day actions of the Flotilla and have functional authority over its movements and plans. The Sith Lords will be advisors to the council and may sit in on any meeting. They will also continue to supersede any military rank on-or-off the battlefield, and maintain any personal commands of their choosing during peace and wartime.</h3></p></div>

<h2><p align="center">Season 2 - A Dark Alliance</p></h2>
		  <button class="accordion">S2E6: A Dark Alliance</button>
			<div class="panel"><p>Darth Malgus has vanished, trading his parlay with the Lord of the Beyond for Otep Kressh's safe return. Soon after, the Lord of the Beyond issued his first royal decree in centuries: declaring the unification of the two greatest conquering forces in The Void: the Imperial Flotilla, and the Empire of the Beyond. Lord Malgus has yet to return or contact the Flotilla, the Mandalorians are in upheaval, and the Beyond is mobilizing a massive invasion force within their borders. It is down to Jaylen, Sharayda, Maila, Atem, and Tenth-Code to affect what changes they can before this war -- with whomever it may be -- begins....</p></div>
	  <button class="accordion">S2E5: Vengeance Is Silent</button>
		<div class="panel"><p>The Flotilla learns the Mandalorians have joined them in The Void. In the days prior to sending their envoy, Jaylen earns a long-overdue promotion, Sharayda becomes leader of Saber Squadron, and many overcharged emotions flare.

		<div class="panel">Sharayda, Jaylen, and Ren cope with Atem's departure, learning about one-another, and themselves. When Jaylen sits his officer's examination alongside Maila, we meet Tenth-Code, a Kregnezzt Engineer with even more technical acumen than Jaylen. While they take their test, Sharayda learns from Leese how to pilot The Omen, and the two of them have a heart-to-heart about her brother's recent promotion. Meanwhile, on the other side of The Void, The Mandalorians arrive under command of Mandalore The Silent, bringing war to the Beyond in retribution for Otep's transformation.</div>

Later, after discovering the lengths to which Veradun will go to protect his sister, Atem decides to leave the Flotilla for the Archons of the True Emperor. Though Jaylen and Sharayda arrive at the last moment to say goodbye, it is clear much remains unspoken between them, and their friendship of many years may have come to an end.</div>
		  <button class="accordion">S2E2: Duties and Dreams</button>
	  <div class="panel">When they traveled to the carbonberg, Jaylen returned with a sphere that had transformed his legs into a serpent's tail. Concentrating, he could maintain an approximation of legs, but he hoped to find a more permanent solution. In searching for one, he contacted a presence within the Transfiguration Sphere: something the sphere was protecting. Hoping to better commune with that presence, Jaylen garners more favor in the flotilla, as Sharayda continues to grow her celebrity aboard The Spine, and Atem discovers the secret behind his brother, Ren's enhanced power. Meanwhile, Healer-apprentice Maila Tashansia introduces herself and our heroes to an unusual species of plant life that seems to react strongly to The Force.</div>

	  <div class="panel">After Otep's transformation into an Acolyte of the Beyond, the Flotilla continues resolutely forward. During the encounter with the Aurora Array, Sharayda noticed a massive space station with several race tracks.
