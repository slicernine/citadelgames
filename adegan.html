	  <p><div class="post"><h2>Remembering a Friend</h2><h3>Though he has been dead for several weeks, there has been no time until now to mourn Atem's passing. Today, a memorial has been planned aboard The Flotilla. With his grandfather long overdue and his father sure not to return, his grandmother and mother have elected to hold the memorial the day his best friends wake from their Bacta induced sleep. 
	  <ul><li><b>Attend the Memorial.</b></li>
		  <p><li><i>[Optional]</i><b>: Prepare some words to say about Atem.</b></li></p></ul></h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>The Flotilla Council</h2><h3>Upon his return, Lord Malgus recognized all of you as the leaders and valued members of the Flotilla that you have become. Aside from receiving a special commendation and award from him personally, you have also been appointed to a special selection committee who will choose the Flotilla's official Leadership Council. Before the war begins, you must nominate those whom you believe to be the best leaders in the Flotilla, filling a seven-seated council from the ground-up. Once the candidates are nominated, the selection committee will appoint the council of 7 from amongst this pool of nominees.</h3></p>  
	<ul><li><b>Nominate capable candidates for the Flotilla Leadership Council.</b></li>
		<p><i><ul><li>You may nominate up to 3 people.</li></ul></i></p>
		  <p><li>Meet with the rest of the selection committee to choose a council of 7 Leaders from amongst the pool of nominees.</li></p></ul>
	<p><h3><b>Note:</b> Darth Malgus, Darth Viscerious, and Darth Ares cannot be nominated to serve on the Leadership Council, which will preside over day-to-day actions of the Flotilla and have functional authority over its movements and plans. The Sith Lords will be advisors to the council and may sit in on any meeting. They will also continue to supersede any military rank on-or-off the battlefield, and maintain any personal commands of their choosing during peace and wartime.</h3></p></div>
