	<p>You and Xanti smashed the "Besh" Circuit record. There are even those saying the score can never be beat! In fact, your celebrity has reached the level where those on The Spine who recognize you far outnumber those who don't. In fact, some members of your growing fanbase will inexplicably seek out and follow your advice on matters completely unrelated to racing, despite the fact that you're famous for being a fast pilot.

	<h2>Completed Missions / Personal Archive</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column archiveleft">
	<button class="accordion">Brother Lost, Family Found</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Atem is gone. He left, and you don't know when or if you'll ever see him again. Part of you feels betrayed, part of you confused, but now that you've talked to Jaylen and Ren, you know that all three of you can carry on without Atem for as long as you need to - even if you hope to one day see your old friend again.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Legacy Of Loyalty, Inherited</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Your long weekend with Leese not only taught you unforgettable lessons in handling The Omen, but it also gave you the chance to bond with your father, who told you of his hopes for you, his pride in you, and reminded you that your brother is still himself, deep down.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Guilty Salvage</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>The simple police surveillance droid you recovered from Kanjiklub's ruined headquarters has been repaired. You elected to repair the memory core and switch its allegiance to you. Later on, when asked why you did so by The Controller, you admitted to having a fondness for the little droid, and he was gifted to you in good faith.</p></div>
	</div>
	  <div class="column archivemiddle">
	<button class="accordion">O' Brother, I See Thou</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Remembering back to your childhood years, you recall when your brother gave you Mr. Bear, your oldest cuddly friend. Now that Veradun has been renamed Darth Ares, you can still see the boy he was in the man he has become. Though you don't fully agree with his methods, you can at least recognize that your brother is far from gone. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Squadron, Bloody Squadron</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You've been promoted to Saber Leader, as First-Thought had hoped. You also found three better-than-average pilots and an ace to replace yourself, Xanti, Jaylen, and Atem in Blood Squadron's ranks. Though First-Thought would likely have preferred more disciplined recruits, their well-developed piloting skills cannot be denied.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Section 3</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Lorem ipsum...</p></div>
	</div>
		  <div class="column archiveright">
	<button class="accordion">Embrace The Warrior Within</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>On an unknown world far from home, the words of a former Sith Lord echo in your mind: "she is a warrior; let her prove it." On the Unknown World, you proved his words right not by combat, but discipline. By placing the needs of the Flotilla above your greed or curiosity, you were able to obtain a powerful space station for the Flotilla, and earned a powerful new ally.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Patience is a Virtue</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Having spoken to your old friend, Third-Patience, about joining the Shards of the Lattice, he agreed to join you for a training session. After successfully creating a transfiguration sphere, you convinced him to join the Shards outright. (<b>Quest Complete: +5 XP; +5 Shards of the Lattice Reputation</b>)</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Soft Feet, Growing Voices</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>After training long and hard, you have learned how to create a Transfiguration Sphere. (<b>Quest Complete: +15 XP; may craft Transfiguration Spheres</b>)</p></div>
