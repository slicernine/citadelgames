	  <p><div class="post"><h2>Remembering a Friend</h2><h3>Though he has been dead for several weeks, there has been no time until now to mourn Atem's passing. Today, a memorial has been planned aboard The Flotilla. With his grandfather long overdue and his father sure not to return, his grandmother and mother have elected to hold the memorial the day his best friends wake from their Bacta induced sleep. 
	  <ul><li><b>Attend the Memorial.</b></li>
		  <li><i>[Optional]</i><b>: Prepare some words to say about Atem.</b></li></ul></h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>The Flotilla Council</h2><h3>Upon his return, Lord Malgus recognized all of you as the leaders and valued members of the Flotilla that you have become. Aside from receiving a special commendation and award from him personally, you have also been appointed to a special selection committee who will choose the Flotilla's official Leadership Council. Before the war begins, you must nominate those whom you believe to be the best leaders in the Flotilla, filling a seven-seated council from the ground-up. Once the candidates are nominated, the selection committee will appoint the council of 7 from amongst this pool of nominees.</h3>
	<ul><li><b>Nominate capable candidates for the Flotilla Leadership Council.</b></li>
		<p><i><ul><li>You may nominate up to 3 people.</li></ul></i></p>
		  <p><li>Meet with the rest of the selection committee to choose a council of 7 Leaders from amongst the pool of nominees.</li></p></ul>
	<h3><b>Note:</b> Darth Malgus, Darth Viscerious, and Darth Ares cannot be nominated to serve on the Leadership Council, which will preside over day-to-day actions of the Flotilla and have functional authority over its movements and plans. The Sith Lords will be advisors to the council and may sit in on any meeting. They will also continue to supersede any military rank on-or-off the battlefield, and maintain any personal commands of their choosing during peace and wartime</h3></div></p>

    <h1>Episodes</h1>
	  	<p><div class="post"><h2>S2E6: A Dark Alliance</h2><h3>Darth Malgus has vanished, trading his parlay with the Lord of the Beyond for Otep Kressh's safe return. Soon after, the Lord of the Beyond issued his first royal decree in centuries: declaring the unification of the two greatest conquering forces in The Void: the Imperial Flotilla, and the Empire of the Beyond. Lord Malgus has yet to return or contact the Flotilla, the Mandalorians are in upheaval, and the Beyond is mobilizing a massive invasion force within their borders. It is down to Jaylen, Sharayda, Maila, Atem, and Tenth-Code to affect what changes they can before this war -- with whomever it may be -- begins....</h3></div></p>
		<p><div class="post"><h2>S2E5: Vengeance Is Silent</h2><h3>The Flotilla learns the Mandalorians have joined them in The Void. In the days prior to sending their envoy, Jaylen earns a long-overdue promotion, Sharayda becomes leader of Saber Squadron, and many overcharged emotions flare. As the Mandalorian Clans reunite with the Flotilla, Caiaphas and Jaylen clash blades, Sharayda meets an Acolyte of the Beyond, and Tenth-Code is offered a spot in Clan Vizsla. As Atem returns to the Flotilla for a brief visit, Otep is released from The Beyond, and in exchange, The Lord of the Beyond parlays with Darth Malgus....</h3></div></p>
		<p><div class="post"><h2>S2E4: When the Dust Settles</h2><h3>Sharayda, Jaylen, and Ren cope with Atem's departure, learning about one-another, and themselves. When Jaylen sits his officer's examination alongside Maila, we meet Tenth-Code, a Kregnezzt Engineer with even more technical acumen than Jaylen. While they take their test, Sharayda learns from Leese how to pilot The Omen, and the two of them have a heart-to-heart about her brother's recent promotion. Meanwhile, on the other side of The Void, The Mandalorians arrive under command of Mandalore The Silent, bringing war to the Beyond in retribution for Otep's transformation.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S2E3: Wolves and Warriors</h2><h3>Sharayda breaks a circuit record for starfighter racing, and reaps the benefits and perils that come with that victory. Ren proves his worth as an ally and reveals some buried feelings, and Veradun's Vanguard is finally exposed. Later, after discovering the lengths to which Veradun will go to protect his sister, Atem decides to leave the Flotilla for the Archons of the True Emperor. Though Jaylen and Sharayda arrive at the last moment to say goodbye, it is clear much remains unspoken between them, and their friendship of many years may have come to an end. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S2E2: Duties and Dreams</h2><h3>When they traveled to the carbonberg, Jaylen returned with a sphere that had transformed his legs into a serpent's tail. Concentrating, he could maintain an approximation of legs, but he hoped to find a more permanent solution. In searching for one, he contacted a presence within the Transfiguration Sphere: something the sphere was protecting. Hoping to better commune with that presence, Jaylen garners more favor in the flotilla, as Sharayda continues to grow her celebrity aboard The Spine, and Atem discovers the secret behind his brother, Ren's enhanced power. Meanwhile, Healer-apprentice Maila Tashansia introduces herself and our heroes to an unusual species of plant life that seems to react strongly to The Force. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>Season 2: A Dark Alliance</h2><h2>E1: Family and Fleet</h2><h3>After Otep's transformation into an Acolyte of the Beyond, the Flotilla continues resolutely forward. During the encounter with the Aurora Array, Sharayda noticed a massive space station with several race tracks. There, at the very least, the Flotilla can enjoy some rest and relaxation... and even find a way to make a whole lot of credits.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E6: Beyond the Sith</h2><h3>The Flotilla is stronger than ever before, and the Grunlans have their supply of Proto-Crystal returned to them. But the Acolytes are powerful, and they intend retribution. Before the end of this brief but violent battle, a valued member of the Flotilla will be lost, and our heroes will never be the same again.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E5: The Next Step</h2><h3>Sharayda lost an arm to the Acolytes of the Beyond, but Darth Malgus slew the perpetrator in vengeance. Now, the Acolytes are massing for a retributive strike against the planet Nu. The Grunlan people have emerged from their hypnotized state, and are willing to fight alongside The Flotilla. However, the Flotilla is too badly outmatched to stand a chance. Their only hope lies in another cluster of vessels that they noticed during their encounter with the Aurora Array: a long-buried gift sent ahead for just an occasion, from one Sith Lord to another.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E4: Lens Of The Lattice</h2><h3>Fleeing the carbonberg with the help of Grit Fearsbane, our heroes return to the Flotilla, having passed this first trial. Grit then leads the Flotilla to his homeworld of Nu, where his people, The Grunlans, are enslaved by the Acolytes of the Beyond. There, Sharayda, Jaylen, and Atem help Grit recover The Aurora Array: a device which can free the Grunlan people from their hypnotic state, as well as reveal a living map of the nearby region of space. However, the Acolytes seek quick retribution when their territory is threatened, and Sharayda learns the hard way what it means to be associated with enemies of The Beyond. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E3: Lessons Of Purpose</h2><h3>Banished to the surface of a barely-breathable carbonberg, Atem, Sharayda, Jaylen, Xanti, Veradun, and Ren must navigate its treacherous caves to recover treasures valuable to the Flotilla. If they fail, they will not be permitted to return to the Flotilla. During the trial, they discover a still-living Acolyte of the Beyond in stasis beneath the surface of a lake, and a strange reptilian creature named Grit Fearsbane that has some connection to The Force. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E2: A Fated Encounter</h2><h3>Intent upon sending these "Sith fools" back from whence they came, a lone shuttle piloted by an Acolyte of the Beyond hinders the diplomatic party in their descent to Kerrakia, shooting down their shuttle. With religious fanatics everywhere, Kerrakia descends into riots while the Acolyte escapes. Jaylen, Atem, and Sharayda befriend a local priestess, Emelyne Ash, and meet Dannith Otessos, a former Jedi whose apprentice has become an Acolyte of the Beyond. </h3></div></p>
<p><div class="post"><h2>Season 1: A Dark Odyssey</h2><h2>E1: A Dark Odyssey</h2><h3>In the opening chapter of our adventure, we meet Jaylen Bylar, Atem Kressh, and Sharayda Hett. Jaylen is the son of Darth Malgus, leader of the Dark Odyssey upon which our heroes have been members for their entire lives. Atem is the son of Malgus's right hand man, Darth Viscerious. The two of them saw battle-after-battle together during the Great Galactic War. Sharayda is the daughter of the Flotilla's best pilot, Leese Hett, and its best fighter, a Mandalorian Supercommando named Narcissa Fett. Together, these three heroes piloted through clouds of nebulous vapor and pirate filth before finding themselves on the world of Kerrakia, a zealous planet under complete control of a mysterious faction known as The Acolytes of the Beyond. </h3></div></p>
