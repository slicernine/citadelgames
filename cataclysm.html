	  <p><div class="post"><h2>Remembering a Friend</h2><h3>Though he has been dead for several weeks, there has been no time until now to mourn Atem's passing. Today, a memorial has been planned aboard The Flotilla. With his grandfather long overdue and his father sure not to return, his grandmother and mother have elected to hold the memorial the day his best friends wake from their Bacta induced sleep. 
	  <ul><li><b>Attend the Memorial.</b></li>
		  <p><li><i>[Optional]</i><b>: Prepare some words to say about Atem.</b></li></p></ul></h3></div>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>The Flotilla Council</h2><h3>Upon his return, Lord Malgus recognized all of you as the leaders and valued members of the Flotilla that you have become. Aside from receiving a special commendation and award from him personally, you have also been appointed to a special selection committee who will choose the Flotilla's official Leadership Council. Before the war begins, you must nominate those whom you believe to be the best leaders in the Flotilla, filling a seven-seated council from the ground-up. Once the candidates are nominated, the selection committee will appoint the council of 7 from amongst this pool of nominees.</h3></p>  
	<ul><li><b>Nominate capable candidates for the Flotilla Leadership Council.</b></li>
		<p><i><ul><li>You may nominate up to 3 people.</li></ul></i></p>
		  <p><li>Meet with the rest of the selection committee to choose a council of 7 Leaders from amongst the pool of nominees.</li></p></ul>
	<h3><p><b>Note:</b> Darth Malgus, Darth Viscerious, and Darth Ares cannot be nominated to serve on the Leadership Council, which will preside over day-to-day actions of the Flotilla and have functional authority over its movements and plans. The Sith Lords will be advisors to the council and may sit in on any meeting. They will also continue to supersede any military rank on-or-off the battlefield, and maintain any personal commands of their choosing during peace and wartime.</p></h3></div>

    <h1>Episodes</h1>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E6: Beyond the Sith</h2><h3>The Flotilla is stronger than ever before, and the Grunlans have their supply of Proto-Crystal returned to them. But the Acolytes are powerful, and they intend retribution. Before the end of this brief but violent battle, a valued member of the Flotilla will be lost, and our heroes will never be the same again.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E5: The Next Step</h2><h3>Sharayda lost an arm to the Acolytes of the Beyond, but Darth Malgus slew the perpetrator in vengeance. Now, the Acolytes are massing for a retributive strike against the planet Nu. The Grunlan people have emerged from their hypnotized state, and are willing to fight alongside The Flotilla. However, the Flotilla is too badly outmatched to stand a chance. Their only hope lies in another cluster of vessels that they noticed during their encounter with the Aurora Array: a long-buried gift sent ahead for just an occasion, from one Sith Lord to another.</h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E4: Lens Of The Lattice</h2><h3>Fleeing the carbonberg with the help of Grit Fearsbane, our heroes return to the Flotilla, having passed this first trial. Grit then leads the Flotilla to his homeworld of Nu, where his people, The Grunlans, are enslaved by the Acolytes of the Beyond. There, Sharayda, Jaylen, and Atem help Grit recover The Aurora Array: a device which can free the Grunlan people from their hypnotic state, as well as reveal a living map of the nearby region of space. However, the Acolytes seek quick retribution when their territory is threatened, and Sharayda learns the hard way what it means to be associated with enemies of The Beyond. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E3: Lessons Of Purpose</h2><h3>Banished to the surface of a barely-breathable carbonberg, Atem, Sharayda, Jaylen, Xanti, Veradun, and Ren must navigate its treacherous caves to recover treasures valuable to the Flotilla. If they fail, they will not be permitted to return to the Flotilla. During the trial, they discover a still-living Acolyte of the Beyond in stasis beneath the surface of a lake, and a strange reptilian creature named Grit Fearsbane that has some connection to The Force. </h3></div></p>
	  <p><div class="post"><h2>S1E2: A Fated Encounter</h2><h3>Intent upon sending these "Sith fools" back from whence they came, a lone shuttle piloted by an Acolyte of the Beyond hinders the diplomatic party in their descent to Kerrakia, shooting down their shuttle. With religious fanatics everywhere, Kerrakia descends into riots while the Acolyte escapes. Jaylen, Atem, and Sharayda befriend a local priestess, Emelyne Ash, and meet Dannith Otessos, a former Jedi whose apprentice has become an Acolyte of the Beyond. </h3></div></p>
<p><div class="post"><h2>Season 1: A Dark Odyssey</h2></h2><h2>E1: A Dark Odyssey</h2><h3>In the opening chapter of our adventure, we meet Jaylen Bylar, Atem Kressh, and Sharayda Hett. Jaylen is the son of Darth Malgus, leader of the Dark Odyssey upon which our heroes have been members for their entire lives. Atem is the son of Malgus's right hand man, Darth Viscerious. The two of them saw battle-after-battle together during the Great Galactic War. Sharayda is the daughter of the Flotilla's best pilot, Leese Hett, and its best fighter, a Mandalorian Supercommando named Narcissa Fett. Together, these three heroes piloted through clouds of nebulous vapor and pirate filth before finding themselves on the world of Kerrakia, a zealous planet under complete control of a mysterious faction known as The Acolytes of the Beyond. </h3></div></p>
