	  <div class="post_new"><h5><font face="EotE Symbol">s</font> I am the Controller</h5>
		  <h3>Tasked by the previous Controller with stewardship of The Spine, you are now free to run the station as you see fit, with the exception that it must remain functionally unbiased to its clientele. For this reason, your role in the Flotilla has been greatly compromised, as the Spine itself will not allow you to assist them with its resources, militarily. This must be disclosed to the Flotilla's leaders as the war planning commences.  
			  <br><ul><li>Speak to Flotilla top brass about being the Controller.</li>
			  <li><b>Speak with the former Controller about how to maintain your position in both the Spine and Flotilla.</b> (Objective Completed: +5 XP)</li></ul></h3></div>

		  <h3>General Vizsla seems to have taken a liking to you, and expressed interest in your helping his clan construct their nebula shipyard. After confessing that you are not much of a fighter, the General (a combat instructor) suggested you might benefit from joining his Mandalorian clan. You know Sharayda has the option of doing something.
			  <br><ul><li><i>[Optional]</i> Talk to Sharayda about the Mandalorian Rites.</li>

	  <h3>Though each of your remotes has a simple consciousness, you notice that the longer they remain active, the more distinct their personalities become. True to form, each one has requested simple upgrades to better improve their functionality. You already had three of the five items available when they made the request; now you only need to find two more:
		  <br><ul><li>Break - Better Weapon (1-6 Enc.)</li>
		  <li>Srando - Better Armor (1-6 Enc.)</li></ul></h3></div>
		  	  <br><div class="post_new"><h5><font face="EotE Symbol">s</font> Questions about the Force</h5>
	  <h3>Many members of your species do not take the time to think about their Force abilities. Yours were completely natural, honed only by innate talent. The question you face as you embark on your journey: do you want to know more? If you do... from what source will you seek your answers?
		  <br><ul><li><i>[Optional]</i> Find a master to teach you the ways of the Force.</li></ul></h3></div>

  <p>Together with Jaylen and Sharayda, you discovered The Controller, a sentient being contained within computer algorithms. Due to your unique understanding of droids and technology, this entity has chosen you as its most-trusted liaison, a protege of sorts. Now Controller of the Spine and its vast array of foundries and droids, you have become apprentice, of sorts, to the previous Controller, as he initiates his Operation Chimaera. You have effectively annexed The Spine by becoming the new Controller.</p>
