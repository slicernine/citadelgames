	<button class="accordion">A New Brother, My Master</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Caiaphas himself stated that you are family. Before your journey to your training ground concluded, he passed on a family secret, helping you construct your first lightsaber: a simple hilt of Phrik and Electrum with a goldenrod blade [Lightsaber / Engaged / Dmg 6 / Crit 2 / Breach 1, Sunder]. You now wield it through endless, intense sparring matches; bonding with your fellow Neophytes... the future Archons with whom you have chosen to serve for the rest of your days.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">The Vanguard Who Could Have Been</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Darth Ares  has accepted your refusal to join the Vanguard. ​You now recognize that he trusts you to bridge the gulf between your culture and his, but it's clear he regards you as an outsider, just as the rest of the Flotilla has come to do. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">A Spark of Light</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>The Beyond is the mortal enemy to all life in The Void, but especially the Archons and the Mandalorians. You helped convince the Flotilla to trust the Archons of the True Emperor, and partially thanks to you, the Flotilla and the Archons are now one Brotherhood. </p></div>
	</div>
	  <div class="column archivemiddle">
	<button class="accordion">The Destiny In Your Veins</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You have answered the call of the Archons, and are now in their realm. Enduring rigorous training under ruthless Centurions and Praetorians, you sometimes dream of a day you may be able to fulfill your promise to stand side-by-side with The Flotilla as they confront The Beyond.

<br><br>Though you continue to train, Caiaphas has returned to the Flotilla. He is only permitted to train you as an Archon once you reach the rank of Praetorian. However, you know it will be months if not years before you attain that level of proficiency.

<br><br>You made this choice. Your gut tells you it was correct. Unfortunately, your heart will remain silent on the matter until you’ve proven yourself correct, and used your power to help your old friends save your father from The Beyond…</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">The Next Archons</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Under the tireless gaze of Praetorian Telaxus, you and your new group of friends struggle to meet expectations in a world where only 2% of Legionary Initiates become Archons.

<br><br>Your chief rival and closest new friend, Initiate Voth, keeps you on your toes whether in the sparring ring, simulator, or classroom. Two more new friends, Initiates Talla and Dredge, cover the gaps in both your and Voth's knowledge and skills (which are nearly identical in function). Dredge reminds you of Ren, both in his boldness, and his penchant to tinker with any object he gets his hands on. Talla reminds you of Ren in her wit and shrewdness, but reminds you of Xanti in her dedication to piloting.

<br><br>Yet, in other ways, these new friends are nothing like yourself and your siblings. Unlike Ren, Dredge is muscular, gruff, and excitable. Unlike Xanti, Talla is devoted to duty, and flies not for thrill, but because it's what she's best at. Unlike you, Voth would be the first in his family line ever promoted to Archon, an honor for which he prays each night. Whatever the differences, as was the case back home, each of you only wishes to see the others succeed.

<br><br>After just a few days, you are already beginning to think of this place as home, and those around you as family. </p>

<button class="accordion">The Worst War</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>With the sacrifice of your grandfather, you have survived the harrowing war of Primis and returned to where you belong. You are now the apprentice to Emperor Utopias I, but the bulk of your current instruction comes from your friend and mentor Caiaphas. <b>(Quest Complete: +10 XP)</b></p></div>

	<button class="accordion">My Odyssey Ends</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>After leaving the Flotilla, dying briefly, and returning to declare yourself still determined to join the Archons, you know you have lost the potential to ever be greatly respected amongst the Flotilla. <b>(Failure Consequence: your Flotilla Reputation can never exceed 85)</b></p>
